3/18/24 Meeting with TA

- Decided on RapidAPI (Axesso) that is connected to Amazon Webstore to get information about products
  - Searches based on keywords and returns the product and its details (product name, image, etc.)
- Basic structure is a gallery where you can browse/search for items and closet where you can save outfits
- More features that could be implemented:
  - Being able to share and rate other outfits
    - Maybe a group chat or social media type sharing method
    - If not, maybe just a link for sharing
  - Expanding beyond the Amazon API
    - Maybe the H&M API
    - Fashion API where you can submit photo and find the most similar clothes
- Adding grouping and sharing outfits as part of the feature list
- Fashion API will be a “nice-to-have”
- Can start with coding and adding pages
- Planning on meeting on Thursday this week
- This week’s evaluation is from Monday to Friday – make sure deliverables are uploaded by then
- Transition to Github project board from Trello
