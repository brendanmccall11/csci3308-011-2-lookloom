3/18/24 Meeting with TA
- Decided on RapidAPI (Axesso) that is connected to Amazon Webstore to get information about products
    - Searches based on keywords and returns the product and its details (product name, image, etc.)
- Basic structure is a gallery where you can browse/search for items and closet where you can save outfits
- More features that could be implemented:
    - Being able to share and rate other outfits
        - Maybe a group chat or social media type sharing method
        - If not, maybe just a link for sharing
    - Expanding beyond the Amazon API 
        - Maybe the H&M API
        - Fashion API where you can submit photo and find the most similar clothes
- Adding grouping and sharing outfits as part of the feature list
- Fashion API will be a “nice-to-have”
- Can start with coding and adding pages 
- Planning on meeting on Thursday this week
- This week’s evaluation is from Monday to Friday – make sure deliverables are uploaded by then
- Transition to Github tasks from Trello
