Group project for CSCI 3308.

## Vision Statement
For aspiring fashionistas, who are looking to bring their outfit ideas to life, LookLoom is a shopping and fashion website that allows users to bring together multiple vendors under a single site and mix and match clothing pieces, categorize outfits, and purchase items. LookLoom is a one stop shop for styling outfits.

## Application Description
  A web app where the user can import pictures of their clothes or choose/search clothes from various online shopping applications and sort those clothes items into different categories. Users can choose items from the LookLoom gallery or by searching for specific items. From there, the user can mix and match items to form outfits and save them to their closet. Users are able to view the total cost of their assembled outfits as well as links to purchase each item.
  Additionally, users can create groups for their outfits and share them with their friends, where they will be able to create reviews. Users can also export photos of their fully assembled outfits to share with friends.
